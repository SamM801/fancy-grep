I hear its song before I see it,
know it's here in the forest
before it knows I'm here
or maybe my ear drags
something larger, something
heavier from the sky to my
brain seeking its sense? Whatever
burns out also sings out, makes
a noise I stir like a fire now as audible
as the color of chalk or a thought
that taunts dully before sleep. Because
they fly, the birds strike borders
in the sky we can't see. I'll return
to this moment later in life dozens
of times. The heat of the day
gristles and glistens to light.
